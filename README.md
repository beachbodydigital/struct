# struct: Automated Project Structure Generator

Struct is a powerful and flexible script designed to automate the creation of project structures based on YAML configurations. It supports template variables, custom file permissions, remote content fetching, and multiple file handling strategies to streamline your development setup process.

## Features

- **YAML Configuration**: Define your project structure in a simple YAML file.
- **Template Variables**: Use placeholders in your configuration and replace them with actual values at runtime.
- **Custom File Permissions**: Set custom permissions for your files directly from the YAML configuration.
- **Remote Content Fetching**: Include content from remote files by specifying their URLs.
- **File Handling Strategies**: Choose from multiple strategies (overwrite, skip, append, rename, backup) to manage existing files.
- **Dry Run**: Preview the actions without making any changes to your file system.
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure your YAML configuration is valid before executing the script.
- **Verbose Logging**: Get detailed logs of the script's actions for easy debugging and monitoring.
